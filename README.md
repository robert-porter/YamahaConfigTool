# YamahaConfigTool

This application is for the configuration of Yamaha receivers that implement the YNCA protocol. For professional AV installers, this allows much faster configuration than the OSD, while also eliminating problems with using the factory remote with a remotely located receiver. The GUI and commands are generated by parsing the example protocol files provided by Yamaha. This allows for close to 100% feature coverage for new devices by simply dropping in a new protocol example file.
